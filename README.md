git clone https://github.com/yourusername/feishu-outlook-sync.git
cd feishu-outlook-sync
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The application uses a YAML file for storing credentials and tokens. On first run, you'll be prompted to enter your credentials.

### tokens.yaml
```yaml
feishu:
  app_info:
    app_id: your_feishu_app_id
    app_secret: your_feishu_app_secret
  tokens:
    app_access_token:
      token: null
      expiration_time: null
    user_access_token:
      token: null
      expiration_time: null
  calendar_id:
    id: null

outlook:
  app_info:
    client_id: your_outlook_client_id
    client_secret: your_outlook_client_secret
    tenant_id: your_tenant_id
  tokens:
    access_token: null
    expiration_time: null
  calendar_id:
    id: null
  authenticated: false
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. On first run:
   - You'll be prompted to enter your Feishu and Outlook credentials
   - Links will be given for authentication (OAuth)
   - Follow the prompts to grant calendar access

3. The application will:
   - Start syncing immediately
   - Check for new events every 5 minutes
   - Log sync activities to the console


## Behavior Specifications

### Event Synchronization
- Only future events are synchronized
- Events are matched based on title and start time
- Timezone differences are automatically handled
- Duplicate events are skipped

### Authentication
- Tokens are automatically refreshed
- Failed authentications trigger re-authorization
- Credentials are securely stored in tokens.yaml

### Error Handling
- Failed syncs are logged but don't stop the process
- Network interruptions are handled gracefully
- Authentication errors trigger automatic token refresh

## Limitations

- One-way sync only (Feishu â†’ Outlook)
- No support for event updates (only creation)
- No attendee synchronization
- Does not sync event cancellations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Authentication Failures
   - Verify credentials in tokens.yaml
   - Check token expiration
   - Ensure proper API permissions
   - Restart the script after one run

2. Missing Events
   - Check timezone settings
   - Verify event dates are in the future
   - Check for duplicate detection issues

3. Sync Issues
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check both calendars are accessible
   - Verify token permissions
